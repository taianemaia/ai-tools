# Awesome UX Skills for Codex

A collection of UX and AI product design skills for [Codex](https://Codex.ai/code). Install them and Codex will automatically apply the right framework when you ask design-related questions.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tommyjepsen/awesome-ux-skills
cd awesome-ux-skills
./install.sh
```

Then restart Codex (or reload the window). That's it.

Re-install or update existing skills:

```bash
./install.sh --force
```

## Skills

### UI Analysis & Improvement

| `accessibility` | Reviews screenshots, mockups, and flows against WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines |
| `ux-heuristics-review` | Audits any UI against Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics |

### AI Product Design

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ai-governors` | Designs human-in-the-loop patterns: action plans, verification, undo, cost estimates, memory, citations |
| `ai-identifiers` | Defines the brand identity of an AI: name, avatar, color, iconography, personality |
| `ai-inputs` | Picks and implements the right input pattern for AI (open text, madlibs, autofill, voice, templates…) |
| `ai-trust-builders` | Adds trust signals: caveats, consent, data ownership, disclosure, watermarks, footprints |
| `ai-tuners` | Lets users configure AI behavior: model switching, filters, modes, parameters, voice & tone |
| `ai-wayfinders` | Reduces blank-slate anxiety with onboarding patterns: example prompts, galleries, tooltips |

## How it works

Each `.md` file is a Codex skill — a prompt that loads into Codex's context when triggered. Codex detects from your request which skill applies and uses it automatically. You can also invoke any skill directly with `/skill-name`.

Skills live at `~/.Codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` after install.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Each skill is a single `.md` file with this structure:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: One clear sentence on what the skill does. Then trigger phrases — 
  when should Codex activate this automatically? Be specific.
---

# Skill content here
```

The `description` field drives automatic activation — write it so Codex knows exactly when to reach for this skill.
